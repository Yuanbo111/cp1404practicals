## Clean Code Lessons Learned

Throughout the subject, I have learned many valuable principles of clean code. Here are three key lessons:

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each function or method should do only one job, which makes it easier to test and reuse.
- **Consistent Naming**: Using descriptive and consistent variable, function, and class names improves readability and understanding.
- **Code Reuse and Modularity**: By writing reusable functions and organizing code into logical units, I can avoid duplication and make maintenance easier.
