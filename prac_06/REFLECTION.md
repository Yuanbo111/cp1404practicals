# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I've started reading through the practical requirements more carefully before writing code, which has helped reduce mistakes and rework. 
I also now test small parts of my code more often before moving forward.
I also learn to commit step by step.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to manage my time better, especially starting tasks earlier instead of close to the deadline. 
I also need to apply feedback from previous pracs more consistently.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I'm understanding the importance of writing clean, reusable code and using functions and classes properly. 
I'm also asking for help when I get stuck instead of staying stuck for too long.
Additionally, I'm maintaining good revision and prevision habits, which help reinforce learning and prepare me better for each prac.


## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop rushing through the practicals just to get them done. 
While completing tasks quickly might feel productive, it often leads to missing important details or making careless mistakes. 
I should spend more time reviewing my code for clarity, structure, and adherence to good programming practices like meaningful naming, modular functions, and proper documentation.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would like to have more practice questions and coding exercises during class time. 
Having more hands-on activities in the tutorials or lectures would help reinforce the weekly concepts and give us more chances to ask questions and get immediate feedback while learning.
